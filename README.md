# DurationAndConvexityCalculator
A VBA and excel workbook that calculates the Macaulay and Modified durations and convexities for bonds, stocks, level perpetuities, and annutities

***Excel and VBA component***

***Graphing Component***

I found during my analysis that the price yeild curve changes over time - the price-yeild curve for a bond is not the same throughout the life of the bond. To show the relationship between the price-yeild curve and time I wrote a python program that plots the different price-yeild curve and connects them to create a price-yeild-time curve. I found that some bonds - depending on the interest rate - changed a lot during the life of the bond as illustated in the graph below

While other bonds did not change as drastically to changes in interest rate. An example of a bond is given by the price-yeild-time curve below.

From this it is clear to see that some bonds protect their holder better against changes in interest rate over time when compared to other bonds. If you as an investor predict that there will be a change in interest rates before your bonds maturity date then you need to precedt the value of that bond. Using this tool you can easily visualize which bonds would reduce your risk to changes in interest rate.
